/// - Decay Floor: A minimum rating threshold based on a player's peak rating
/// - Wednesday Decay: All decay adjustments occur at Wednesday 12:00 UTC
/// - Unified Adjustments: Rating and volatility changes combined into single adjustments

/// - Rating decay: Applied to players inactive for more than `DECAY_DAYS` (184 days)

/// Call `prepare_decay_pass(up_to)` first to check if there are Wednesdays to process.
